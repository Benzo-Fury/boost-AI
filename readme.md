# Boost-AI
Are you tired of being just an ordinary human with boring everyday tasks? Want to take your cognitive abilities to the next level and become a superhuman? Look no further, because Boost-AI is here to turn you and your project into a genius.

## What is this?
Boost-AI is an open-source project that aims to enhance your willpower... I mean codepower (if that's even a word). We took the boring old shitty openAI api and turned it into something great. Honestly... using this package will change your life, your dad might even come back?

## How does it work?
We're not exactly sure. The creators of Boost-AI claim it uses a combination of AI algorithms and black magic to understand your code and provide you with amazing API requests that are totally better than the original one. But let's be real, they probably just Googled "how to create an npm package that uses AI" and copied the first tutorial they found. 

## Can I use it with my project?
Oh, of course, you want to know if our amazing creation is compatible with your project. Well, let's just say that Boost-AI was created by a 15-year-old who was fueled by nothing but pizza and Mountain Dew, so the odds are not in your favor. And if you were planning on using ESM, well, sorry to burst your bubble, but we don't support that. Don't worry, though, we're sure you'll find something else to use. And while we're at it, let's be real here, Boost-AI is just an improvement to the openAI API, so it's probably not even that great. But hey, who needs quality when you have sheer confidence, right?

## Install
Installing Boost-AI is as easy as falling off a log. Just type the command below into your console on your own personal computer and hope nothing bad happens.
```sh
npm install boost-AI
```

## Examples
Wow, do we really have to spell everything out for you? You can't just magically figure out how this thing works on your own? Okay, fine, we'll throw you a bone and provide some examples. But don't get too excited, we're not going to hold your hand every step of the way. After all, if you can't even figure out how to use an AI api on your own, how are you ever going to conquer the world?

Boss: "Gee, thanks for finally realizing that our users might need a little bit of help. I knew I could always count on you to deliver top-quality sarcasm with a side of helpfulness."

### API Instance
Ready to experience the mind-blowing power of Boost-AI's advanced AI features? Great! But first, you'll need to create an API instance.
```ts
import { boostAI } from "boost-ai";

const connection = new boostAI("your open ai api key");
//if your using a process.env variable you might need to use (as string)
```

### Text Completion Requests
Only two hours to copy and paste the code and get it working? You're practically a genius. Now, onto the exciting stuff: sending text completion requests with Boost-AI. Who needs a life outside of coding when you have our AI-powered package to keep you entertained? So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride to the future of software development (or at least, that's what we like to tell ourselves).
